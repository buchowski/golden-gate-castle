# golden-gate-castle

- Clone to your local
- Launch Unity and
- Open `golden-gate-castle`
- **Note** Because git doesn't track empty directories, you will need to add these two empty directories in order for Unity to open the project: 
  - `golden-gate-castle/Assets/`
  - `golden-gate-castle/Library/`
